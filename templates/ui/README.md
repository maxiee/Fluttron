# UI Template

This folder represents the Flutter Web UI template.

Minimum expectations:

- `lib/main.dart` calls `runFluttronUi(...)` from `fluttron_ui`.
- `pubspec.yaml` depends on `fluttron_ui` and `fluttron_shared`.
- Build output goes to `build/web/` and will be copied to the host `assets/www/`.
